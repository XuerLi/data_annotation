      <h2>What are conditional claims?</h2>
      <p>
        A conditional claim consists of a condition and a conclusion. It often takes the form of 'If P, then Q'.  GIVE FAMILIER EXAMPLE.
        P is the condition, and Q is the conclusion.
  The condition is a set of circumstances that, if true, result in the conclusion.
  The example below is a conditional.
  <ul>
      <li>if Natalia had left at 10 a.m. yesterday, she would have arrived on time. </li>
      <li>If it rains tomorrow, then I am going to wear my boots. </li>
      <li>Unless I get an offer tomorrow, I will take a vacation as a break.</li>
  </ul>
      </p>
      <h2> Speaker's belief</h2>
        <p>The speaker of a conditional claim may indicate that they believe that the condition is not satisfied in reality i.e.
        it is not true. For instance, in the first example above, the speaker indicates that Natalia did not leave at 10 am -
        they believe that the condition is not true.
        <p>However, this is not the case for every conditional claim.</p>
        In the claim: 'If Natalia departed at 10 a.m. yesterday, she will attend the meeting this afternoon',
        the speaker believes the condition might be true. It is implied that they believe it is possible that Natalia
        departed at 10 a.m. yesterday.</p>
        <p>The same applies to the conclusion. The speaker may believe the conclusion is not true,
          or they may believe that the conclusion might be true. </p>

      <h2>Is a claim verifiable?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Verifiable claims describe statements that can be proven true or false using facts, e.g.,
          the following claim is verifiable and it is true: New York is the capital city of the US. </li>
          <li>Non-verifiable claims are neither true nor false. They express a belief, attitude, value, judgment, or feeling,
            e.g., dogs are the best mammals in existence or World War II was a terrible war. According to Mometrix,
            "the claim—“World War II was a terrible war”—strikes many of us as factual. However, this is an opinion...
            It is very rare for a claim with a value word like “terrible” to be factual." </li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Is it true? </h2>
      A verifiable claim can be true or false. As everyone has a limit to their knowledge, it's possible that we know a claim is verifiable,
      e.g., a capital city of a country, but we do not know the answer.
      Thus, there will be an option of 'I don't know' to choose in this annotation.
      <h2> Does a conclusion follow its condition? </h2>
        <p>A conclusion Q follows its condition P, if P causes Q. Thus, when P happens, Q will happen as a result.</p>
