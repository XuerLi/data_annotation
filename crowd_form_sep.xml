<p>Xue Li, Postdoc in the ILCC/AIAI/ELIAI institutes, the University of Edinburgh. </p>

 <h3>What is the purpose of the study? </h3>
<p>We are working on developing a system to automatically detect misinformation from counterfactual claims in the domain of climate change.
In this study, human participants will be needed to annotate selected Reddit claims with their truth values, to generate training data for the misinformation detection system.
This annotation will be done via public platforms, i.e., Amazon Mechanical Turk, which protects participants' personal information.
During the annotation, participants will give truth values using a web App that we wrote, which does not collect any personal information.</p>

 <h3>Why have I been asked to take part? </h3>
<p>You have been asked to take part because you choose to annoate our data via Amazon Mechanical Turk.</p>

 <h3>Do I have to take part? </h3>
<p>No – participation in this study is entirely up to you. You can stop and at any time, without giving a reason.
In our study, no personal data will be asked or touched in any way.
We will only use the truth values that you labelled for the purpose of this study.
Your rights will not be affected. If you wish to withdraw, contact the PI.
We will keep copies of your original consent, and of your withdrawal request.</p>

<h3>What will happen if I decide to take part? </h3>
<p>That means you have read this consent and are happy with it. Then you will be given the data as pairs of an antecedent and a consequence via this web App, of which you will assign the truth values and choose whether an antecedent entails its consequence.  You can stop at any time and the labels you’ve given will be recorded and saved by the web App, which are the only data that we will collect.
Compensation.
You will be paid for your participation in this study via Amazon Mechanical Turk. </p>

<h3>Are there any risks associated with taking part?</h3>

      <h2>What are conditional claims?</h2>
      <p>
        A conditional claim consists of a condition and a conclusion. It often takes the form of '<span style = "color: blue">If P, </span> <span style="color: purple">then Q</span> ' with P as the condition, and Q as the conclusion. Some examples are given below, where condition is written in blue and conclusion in purple.
  The condition is a set of circumstances that, if true, result in the conclusion.
  The example below is a conditional.
  <ul>
      <li><span style = "color: blue">If it rains,</span> <span style="color: purple">the ground will be wet. </span> </li>
      <li><span style = "color: blue">Unless I get an offer tomorrow, </span> <span style="color: purple">I will take a vacation as a break.</span></li>
      <li><span style = "color: blue">If there were no greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, </span> <span style="color: purple"> then the Earth's temperature would be much colder.</span> </li>

  </ul>
      </p>
      <h2> Speaker's belief</h2>
          <p>In some conditional claims, the speaker indicates whether or not they think the condition is true, i.e. it is not satisfied in reality. For instance, in the last example above, of which the condition is 'there are <span style = "font-weight:bold">no</span> greenhouse gases in the atmosphere' but the speaker indicates that 'there are greenhouse gases in the atmosphere'.
        <p>However, this is not the case for every conditional claim.</p>
        In the first claim above, the speaker does not say anything about whether or not the condition is likely to be true (that is, whether
            it will rain). It is implied that they believe it is possible that .</p>
        <p>The same applies to the conclusion. The speaker may believe the conclusion is not true,
          or they may believe that the conclusion might be true. </p>

      <h2>Is a claim verifiable?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Verifiable claims describe statements that can be proven true or false using facts, e.g.,
          the following claim is verifiable and it is true: "Washington, DC, is the capital of the US." The follwing claim
              is verifiable and false: "New York City is the capital of the US."</li>
          <li>Non-verifiable claims are neither true nor false. They express a belief, attitude, value, judgment, or feeling,
            e.g., "dogs are the best animals in the world" or "chocolate is my favourite flavour of ice cream".</li>
            <li>Sometimes the line between verifiable claims and non-verifiable claims can be a hard to draw. For
                the purpose of this annotation task, please consider all claims to be non-verifiable that express beliefs,
                attitudes or value judgments - even if most people would agree with the claim. For example, "World War II was a
                terrible war." This claim strikes many of us as factual, but it is considered a non-verifiable claim here
                because of the word "terrible" which expresses a value. In contrast, "many people died in World War II"
            is verifiable.</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Is it true? </h2>
      A verifiable claim can be true or false. As everyone has a limit to their knowledge, it's possible that we know a claim is verifiable,
      e.g., a capital city of a country, but we do not know the answer. If you do not know the answer, please choose 'I don't know.'

      <h2> Does the conclusion follow the condition? </h2>
        <p>A conclusion Q follows its condition P, if P causes Q. Thus, when P happens, Q will happen as a result. There are different levels of how much a conclusion follows/caused by a condition. We catagorise them into five catagories listed below. </p>
          <ul>
              <li> Absolutely (if the condition P happened, then the conclusion Q would happen for sure). </li>
            <li>Probably (if P happened, it would dramatically increase the chance of Q becoming a fact). </li>
            <li>Maybe (if P happened, it would mediumly increase the chance of Q becoming a fact). </li>
            <li>Less likely (if P happened, it would minorly increase the chance of Q becoming a fact). </li>
             <li>Not at all (P has nothing to do with the happenning of Q.)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Please find examples of these catagories below.</p>
          <p><span style = "font-weight:bold">Absolutely.</span> In some conditional claims, the conclusion follow the condition.</p>
       <ul>
          <li>If Elon Musk buys Twitter, he will own one of the biggest social media sites in the world.</li>
       </ul>

      <p>In the above example, the condition happens to be true. However, it is also possible for the conclusion to follow the condition
      in cases where the condition is false or we don't know if the condition is true.</p>

      <ul>
          <li>If Barack Obama lived in the 19th century, he would have never been elected President of the US.</li>
          <li>If Bill Gates had bought Twitter, he would be owning one of the bigges social media sites in the world.</li>
      </ul>

      <span style = "font-weight:bold">Probably or Maybe.</span> Sometimes we don't know if the conclusion follows the condition, but we can make a guess. The following claims are probably true,
      although we don't know anything about Natalia and her mum:

      <ul>
      <li>If Natalia cleans up her room, her mum will be happy.</li>
      </ul>

      <span style = "font-weight:bold">Less likely.</span> The following claims are probably not true:
      <ul>
      <li>If we stop climate change, the price of ice cream will drop.</li>
      </ul>

       <span style = "font-weight:bold">Not at all.</span> Sometimes we know for sure that the conclusion does not follow the condition. This is the case, for example, when the condition and the conclusion have nothing to do with one another, but also .
       <ul>
          <li>If Elon Musk buys Twitter, then the COVID-19 pandemic will be over.</li>
           <li>If the sea levels rise by 1 mm, life on this planet as we know it will be over.</li>
